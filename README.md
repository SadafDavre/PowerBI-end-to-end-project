##Project Proposal:

#Business Challenge: Enhance Diabetes Prevention and Management
Our Business Challenge is to analyze and determine which medical conditions play a significant role and are found in patients prone to diabetes. We will be able to suggest to those patients whether they should get tested for diabetes or not, based on pre-existing medical conditions. We will leverage a diabetes prediction dataset to develop reports and analytics that can help identify individuals at risk of developing diabetes and provide insights for better patient care.

Source Data Sets: “Diabetes prediction dataset”

#Description and columns of chosen dataset:
Patients: Contains patient information (e.g. age, gender, BMI).
Medical History: Stores historical patient medical records (e.g., hypertension,smoking history, bmi, hbA1c levels, blood glucose levels).
Diabetes Predictions: A table to store diabetes  scores for each patient.

Electronic Health Records (EHRs) are the primary source of data for the Diabetes Prediction dataset. EHRs are digital versions of patient health records that contain information about their medical history, diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes. The data in EHRs is collected and stored by healthcare providers, such as hospitals and clinics, as part of their routine clinical practice.

#Questions we hope to answer:
1.	How will we collect, clean and consolidate/transform historical patient data, including medical records and lifestyle information?
2.	What insights can we gain from descriptive analytics when analyzing historical patient data?
3.	How can we identify common comorbidities or risk factors among diabetic patients using this data?
4.	What types of reports will be developed to summarize patient risk profiles, intervention outcomes, and trends in diabetes prevention and management?How will these reports be used to provide feedback to healthcare providers for informed decision-making?
